# Lab: Access resource secrets more securely across services

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure user interface (UI) changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

    ```javascript
    var blobServiceClient = await BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to use the **BlobServiceClient.getContainerClient** method, while passing in the **drop** container name to create a new instance of the **BlobContainerClient** class that references the container that you created earlier in this lab:

    ```javascript
    var containerClient = await blobServiceClient.getContainerClient("drop");
    ```

1.  Add the following lines of code to use the **BlobContainerClient.exists** method, while passing reference to  **drop** container to check if the container exists:

    ```javascript
        if (await containerClient.exists()) {
             context.res = {
                body: `container found`
            };
        }
    ```
    
1.  Observe the **index.js** file, which should now include:

    ```javascript
    const { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');

    module.exports = async function (context, req) {
        context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

        var connectionString = process.env['StorageConnectionString'];
        var blobServiceClient = await BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
        var containerClient = await blobServiceClient.getContainerClient("drop");
        if (await containerClient.exists()) {
             context.res = {
                body: `container found`
            };
        }
    }
    ```
1. You can test the function again. IF the container found in the blob you will get appropriate message. If you get empty response or error you should check if the container exists.

#### Task 4: Download a blob

1.  Add the following line of code to use the **BlobServiceClient.getContainerClient()** method, while passing in the **records.json** blob name to create a new instance of the **BlockBlobClient** class that references the blob that you uploaded earlier in this lab:

    ```javascript
    var blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient('records.json');
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to use the **BlockBlobClient.download** method to download the contents of the referenced blob asynchronously and store the result in a variable named *downloadBlockBlobResponse*:

    ```javascript
    var downloadBlockBlobResponse = await blockBlobClient.download(0);
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to return the various content stored in the *downloadBlockBlobResponse* variable by using the additional **streamToString** function, you can paste the code above the main function:

    ```javascript
    async function streamToString(readableStream) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            const chunks = [];
            readableStream.on('data', (data) => {
                chunks.push(data.toString());
            });
            readableStream.on('end', () => {
                resolve(chunks.join(''));
            });
            readableStream.on('error', reject);
        });
    }
    ```

1. Finlay you need to add call to the streamToString function from the main function and return content as response:
  
    ```javascript
    var filecontent = await streamToString(downloadBlockBlobResponse.readableStreamBody);
    context.res = {
        body: filecontent
    };
    ```   

1.  Observe the final code:

    ```javascript
    const { BlobServiceClient } = require('@azure/storage-blob');
    
    async function streamToString(readableStream) {
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            const chunks = [];
            readableStream.on('data', (data) => {
                chunks.push(data.toString());
            });
            readableStream.on('end', () => {
                resolve(chunks.join(''));
            });
            readableStream.on('error', reject);
        });
    }

    module.exports = async function (context, req) {
        context.log('JavaScript HTTP trigger function processed a request.');

        var connectionString = process.env['StorageConnectionString'];
        var blobServiceClient = await BlobServiceClient.fromConnectionString(connectionString);
        var containerClient = await blobServiceClient.getContainerClient("drop");
        if (await containerClient.exists()) {
            var blockBlobClient = containerClient.getBlockBlobClient('records.json');
            var downloadBlockBlobResponse = await blockBlobClient.download(0);
            var filecontent = await streamToString(downloadBlockBlobResponse.readableStreamBody);
            context.res = {
                body: filecontent
            };
        }
    }
    ```

1.  Select **Save and run** to save the script and perform a test of the function.

1.  Find the **Output** text box in the Test pane. You should now notice the content of the **$/drop/records.json** blob stored in your storage account.

1. In the Azure portal's navigation pane, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (\>) and underscore character (\_).

1. If this is your first time opening Cloud Shell using your subscription, you can use the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** to configure Cloud Shell for first-time usage. Perform the following actions in the wizard:

    1. A dialog box prompts you to create a new storage account to begin using the shell. Accept the default settings, and then select **Create storage**.

    > **Note**: Wait for Cloud Shell to finish its initial setup procedures before moving forward with the lab. If Cloud Shell configuration options don't display, this is most likely because you are using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written with the presumption that you are using a new subscription.

#### Task 2: Delete a resource group

1. When you receive the command prompt, enter the following command, and then select Enter to delete the **ConfidentialStack** resource group:

    ```powershell
    az group delete --name ConfidentialStack --no-wait --yes
    ```
    
1.  Close the Cloud Shell pane in the portal.

#### Task 3: Close the active application

1. Close the currently running Microsoft Edge application.

> **Review**: In this exercise, you cleaned up your subscription by removing the resource groups used in this lab.
