# Lab: Publishing and subscribing to Event Grid events

## Microsoft Azure user interface

Given the dynamic nature of Microsoft cloud tools, you might experience Azure UI changes after the development of this training content. These changes might cause the lab instructions and lab steps to not match up.

Microsoft updates this training course when the community brings needed changes to our attention; however, because cloud updates occur frequently, you might encounter UI changes before this training content updates. **If this occurs, adapt to the changes, and then work through them in the labs as needed.**

## Instructions

### Before you start

#### Review the installed applications

Find the taskbar on your Windows 10 desktop. The taskbar contains the icons for the applications that you'll use in this lab:
    
-   Microsoft Edge

-   Microsoft Visual Studio Code

### Exercise 1: Create Azure resources

#### Task 1: Open the Azure portal

1.  On the taskbar, select the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

1.  In the open browser window, go to the Azure portal (<https://portal.azure.com>).

1.  Enter the email address for your Microsoft account, and then select **Next**.

1.  Enter the password for your Microsoft account, and then select **Sign in**.

    > **Note**: If this is your first time signing in to the Azure portal, you'll be offered a tour of the portal. Select **Get Started** to skip the tour and begin using the portal.

#### Task 2: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1.  In the Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (\>) and underscore character (\_).

1.  If this is your first time opening Cloud Shell using your subscription, you can use the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** to configure Cloud Shell. Perform the following actions in the wizard:
    
    -   When a dialog box prompts you to create a new storage account to begin using the shell, accept the default settings, and then select **Create storage**. 

    > **Note**: Wait for Cloud Shell to finish its initial setup procedures before continuing with the lab. If you don't notice the **Cloud Shell** configuration options, this is most likely because you're using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written with the presumption that you're using a new subscription.

1.  In Azure portal, at the **Cloud Shell** command prompt enter the following command, and then select Enter to get the version of the Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI) tool:

    ```
    az --version
    ```

#### Task 3: View the Microsoft.EventGrid provider registration

1.  At the **Cloud Shell** command prompt in the portal, perform the following actions:

    1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to get a list of subgroups and commands at the root level of the Azure CLI:

        ```
        az --help
        ```

    1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to get a list of the commands that are available for resource providers:

        ```
        az provider --help
        ```

    1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to list all currently registered providers:

        ```
        az provider list
        ```

    1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to list just the namespaces of the currently registered providers:

        ```
        az provider list --query "[].namespace"
        ```

    1.  Review the list of currently registered providers. Notice that the **Microsoft.EventGrid** provider is currently included in the list of providers.

1.  Close the Cloud Shell pane.

    var topicCreds = new msRestAzure.TopicCredentials(topicKey);
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **egClient** of type **[EventGridClient]()**, using the **topicCreds** variable as a constructor parameter:

    ```javascript
    var egClient = new eventGrid(topicCreds);
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **topicHostName**, using the **url.parse** method and extract the host name:

    ```javascript   
    var topicUrl = url.parse(topicEndPoint, true);
    var topicHostName = topicUrl.host;
    ```

1.  Add the following line of code to create a new variable named **events** of type array.

    ```javascript  
    var events = [];
    ```

1.  Select any of the events and review its JSON content.

1.  Return to the Azure portal.

#### Review

In this exercise, you published new events to your Event Grid topic using a console application.

### Exercise 4: Clean up your subscription 

#### Task 1: Open Azure Cloud Shell

1.  In Azure portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open a new shell instance.

    > **Note**: The **Cloud Shell** icon is represented by a greater than sign (\>) and underscore character (\_).

1.  If this is your first time opening Cloud Shell using your subscription, you can use the **Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell Wizard** to configure Cloud Shell for first-time usage. Perform the following actions in the wizard:
    
    1.  A dialog box prompts you to create a new storage account to begin using the shell. Accept the default settings, and then select **Create storage**. 

    > **Note**: Wait for Cloud Shell to finish its initial setup procedures before moving forward with the lab. If you don't notice the Cloud Shell configuration options, this is most likely because you're using an existing subscription with this course's labs. The labs are written with the presumption that you're using a new subscription.

#### Task 2: Delete resource groups

1.  Enter the following command, and then select Enter to delete the **PubSubEvents** resource group:
